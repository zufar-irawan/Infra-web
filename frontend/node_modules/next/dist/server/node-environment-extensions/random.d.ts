/**
 * We extend Math.random() during builds and revalidates to ensure that prerenders don't observe randomness
 * When cacheComponents is enabled. randomness is a form of IO even though it resolves synchronously. When cacheComponents is
 * enabled we need to ensure that randomness is excluded from prerenders.
 *
 * The extensions here never error nor alter the random generation itself and thus should be transparent to callers.
